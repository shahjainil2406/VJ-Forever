            <p>
                I still remember that day 📅 when my Mom called and asked me to see a couple of
                biodatas. It was a regular day, ekdum simple divas hato, and I was just casually 
                scrolling through each of them... and then, suddenly, my eyes fell on <b>your</b>
                biodata. ✨
            </p>

            <p>
                Architect! 🏗️ wo bhi CEPT se, matlab, Kaafi padhi-likhi aur sundar... <i>nai nai</i>,
                sundar nai, <b>haseen ladki!</b> 😍 Mane thayu ke "Vaah, aa to bahu j jordar chhe!" 
            </p>

            <p>
                But I pulled myself back and said to myself, "Chalo, let's not hype it up too 
                much, pehla baat karke dekhte hai." 😊 Then I remember that first <b>"Heyy"</b>
                of <b>18th May 2025</b>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And oh god, you were taking forever to reply! 😂 <i>Ketli raah jovdaavi ti 
                tame madamji!</i> But who knew at that time that I was actually talking to the
                love of my life? ❤️
            </p>

            <p>
                But but... the real highlight is <b>20th May</b>. That day when you scolded me
                😏... I don't want to say more about it here (just check the screenshots of 
                that chat in the following memory section below! 📸). 
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                Looking back, I am so glad I swiped right on your life. You are the best thing
                that ever happened to me. 💍✨

            <p>
                I still can’t forget that 24th June 2025. Just a normal birthday and suddenly I get Swiggy notification <b>“Vidhi sent something for you”</b>. We barely knew each other and our taste and preferences at that time, but that tir-i-miss-you was on spot. I loved it, and I 
                was on sugar cut, yet I finished whole tiramisu on my own, two days though 😅. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I think now I believe the fact that “A guy who never celebrates his bday always end up with
                a girl who will celebrate it like a festival”. At that moment, I felt so much attracted to you, not because of tiramisu, but because the way you even cared to make it special even though we were not that much attached. I love you my tiramisu 💕❤️. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After that I flew to Mumbai to meet you on <b>28th June</b> and it was some best hours of 
                my life (until then 😜, after that I had many more best hours that I cannot explain 😉). I remember starting with “Mannat” where we strolled around near ocean with cool breeze even with you beside me hottie (with your vaadiya 😘). I legit thought to do that SRK pose near that, but controlled thinking you would think of me as some crazy person. But after knowing you more and the kind of fandom you have for SRK, I guess agar e time e kari lidhu pose, to aapda Lagan vehla thai jata 😂. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And after that we went to Nutcracker and as soon as we stepped in, do you recall which 
                song was played ? Yes “Die with a Smile”, the song, which I was hooked to then. And I 
                thought that was something you did, in case if that was planned, probably aa letter tane 
                2-3 mahina pehla madtu 😂. Then we did something that everyone would judge us for, 
                watching Housefull 5 on first date, and yaad che pelu couple sitting next to you 
                chota chot and gulu gulu karta ta 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩. But movie start thata pehla and interval ma you were
                 so silent dude, but its okay it was first time we met and we had talked over call so many times.
            </p>

            <p>
                After that we went to some cafe which was overcrowded, so we waited for sometime clicked 
                some selfies and left. And at last, I went for Clubbing, and what I know of is that, it was
                when I kind of won your heart (I guess).
            </p>

            <p>
                But, ena pachi came <b>4th July</b>, when you went to Vadodara, to meet my side
                of family and what moti mummy told me, “Fatakdi che ekdum” 😂, and you won my
                family's heart already, and I was so much relieved then, as my side of family
                was ready for this, but now everything was on me to impress your side of family
                and dude I was so much under stress 😅.
            </p>    
                
            <p>
                But by that time we were that much close that we had started taking each other's
                opinion to buy stuff, you went to buy glasses for you and you asked me to help 
                you choose with that big pimple 😂, and I literally chose the best one for you, 
                my naina. And I was taking your help for my Thailand trip and dude. And me sharing
                my daily stuff with you from Thailand, and making fake story to my friends because they
                caught me doing gulu gulu 😅 on phone.

                Aa letter kaya divas maate che e to tane khbr padi gai, but lets go some days back, when I just returned from 
                Thailand and thoughout the trip I was wondering k "aisa to kya puchna hai mujhe, papa e badhu to kai didhu, hu
                pan to same j kais to vaat karvi su che ?". Then after returning, I asked you and they way you prepared me for 
                <b>the exam 😂</b>, that is when I realised that sirf mujhe hi nai pasand tu, tu bhi mujhe utna hi pasand karti
                hai.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then the day came, <b>26th July, 2026</b>, I was on call, and And I remember to tell your parents same, so that
                they don't think k "hoshiyaari maare che, aavo jamai na joie" 😅. But at end aapda ne Pune farvani permission aapi.
                And we selected dagdusheth mandir, I guess if start is such spiritual, to apna milna to hona hi tha. Then we had tea, and I
                still remeber your face when you tried that sugarless tea ☕️. Then we were heading to Poetry and we were getting calls
                for congratulations 😂.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the way we discussing that we will not have blue drum at home, and you know what now I don't mind having blue drum or 
                garbage bag at home, because the amount of love we have for each other, I guess blue drum will be helpful to store stuff 😜.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then comes that cheesecake time, no actually the Dal Chawal time, and finally when we both decided to take the leap of faith 
                and commit to each other. And I think that was the best decision of my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                And later that night, aapda gharwala e decide karyu k kale ne kalej god-dhana, for a sec mari faati gai k badhu bau fast thaay che,
                pan sahi tha, naito pacha lagan garmi ma shift thai jata 😜. E divase you me Manasi and Aanchal ran to get clothes for me because 
                unlike you I had planned for just meet 😆. Yet on the next day I was shopping my shoes just an hour before the ritual 😂.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                Ahh <b>27th July</b> was the official start of our courtship period, and I couldn't be more happy. But that awkward photoshoot, that 
                awkward dance and just talking with someone over call without even knowing them 😂. Cwaazzzyyy thing, but I am glad to have you in my life.
                I love you beblu 🥰.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then on 28th July, we went out roaming in mall and played, and you showed your power by punching the bag so hard that score was still in 
                triple digits only 😂. But later that night, when I had to leave for Bangalore and that quick forehead kiss (quick because I was feeling shy), 
                and after that was the first time I said <b>I love you</b> becuase I was already missing you and really didn't want to go back to Bangalore.

        <p>My Sweet Darling,</p>
        
        <p>August 15th, 2025 - you flew all the way to Bangalore, and on the 16th, we shared 
        our first kiss. That moment when our lips met for the first time was pure magic - 
        tender, sweet, and filled with all the love we'd been building between us.</p>
        
        <p>I remember the butterflies, the anticipation, the way time seemed to stop when 
        we finally kissed. It wasn't just our first kiss - it was the physical expression 
        of everything we felt for each other, all the love and longing and connection we'd 
        been sharing through words and looks and touches.</p>
        
        <p>That kiss sealed something between us, made our love feel more real, more 
        tangible. It was soft and sweet and perfect, just like you. It was worth waiting 
        for, worth all the distance and time that led us to that moment.</p>
        
        <p>Independence Day weekend became our own celebration of love and freedom - the 
        freedom to love each other completely, to express our feelings without holding back, 
        to be truly together in every way.</p>
