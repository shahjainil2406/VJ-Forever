                I still remember that day 📅 when my Mom called and asked me to see a couple of biodatas. It was a regular day, ekdum simple divas hato, and I was just casually scrolling through each of them... and then, suddenly, my eyes fell on <b>your</b> biodata. ✨
            </p>

            <p>
                Architect! 🏗️ Kaafi padhi-likhi aur sundar... <i>nai nai</i>, sundar nai, <b>haseen ladki!</b> 😍 Mane thayu ke "Vaah, aa to bahu j jordar chhe!" 
            </p>

            <p>
                But I pulled myself back and said to myself, "Chalo, let's not hype it up too much, pehla baat karke dekhte hai." 😊 Then I remember that first <b>"Heyy"</b> of <b>18th May 2025</b>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And oh god, you were taking forever to reply! 😂 <i>Ketli raah jovdaavi ti tame!</i> But who knew at that time that I was actually talking to the love of my life? ❤️
            </p>

            <p>
                But but... the real highlight is <b>20th May</b>. That day when you scolded me 😏... I don't want to say more about it here (just check the screenshots of that chat in the following memory section below! 📸). 
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                Looking back, I am so glad I swiped right on your life. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. 💍✨

                I still can’t forget that 24th June 2025. Just a normal birthday and suddenly I get Swiggy notification <b>“Vidhi sent something for you”</b>. We barely knew each other and our taste and preferences at that time, but that tir-i-miss-you was on spot. I loved it, and I was on sugar cut, yet I finished whole tiramisu on my own, two days though 😅. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I think now I believe the fact that “A guy who never celebrates his bday always end up with a girl who will celebrate it like a festival”. At that moment, I felt so much attracted to you, not because of tiramisu, but because the way you even cared to make it special even though we were not that much attached. I love you my tiramisu 💕❤️. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After that I flew to Mumbai to meet you on <b>28th June</b> and it was some best hours of my life (until then 😜, after that I had many more best hours that I cannot explain 😉). I remember starting with “Mannat” where we strolled around near ocean with cool breeze even with you beside me hottie (with your vaadiya 😘). I legit thought to do that SRK pose near that, but controlled thinking you would think of me as some crazy person. But after knowing you more and the kind of fandom you have for SRK, I guess agar e time e kari lidhu pose, to aapda Lagan vehla thai jata 😂. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And after that we went to Nutcracker and as soon as we stepped in, do you recall which song was played ? Yes “Die with a Smile”, the song, which I was hooked to then. And I legit thought was that something you did, in case if that was planned, probably aa letter tone 2-3 mahina pehla madtu 😂. Then we did something that everyone would judge us for, watching Housefull 5 on first date, and yaad che pelu couple sitting next to you chota chot and gulu gulu karta ta 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩. But movie start thata pehla and interval ma you were so silent dude, but its okay it was first time we met and we had talked over call so many times.
            </p>

            <p>
                After that we went to some cafe which was overcrowded, so we waited for sometime clicked some selfies and left. And at last, I went for Clubbing, and what I know of is that, it was when I kind of won your heart (I guess).
            </p>

            <p>
                But, ena pachi came <b>4th July</b>, when you went to Vadodara, to meet my side of family and what moti mummy told me, “Fatakdi che ekdum” 😂, and you won my family's heart already, and I was so much relieved then, as my side of family was ready for this, but now everything was on me to impress your side of family and dude I was so much under stress 😅.
            </p>    
                
            <p>
                But by that time we were that much close that we had started taking each other's opinion to buy stuff, you went to buy glasses for you and you asked me to help you choose with that big pimple 😂, and I literally chose the best one for you, my naina. And I was taking your help for my Thailand trip and dude. And me shaing my daily stuff with you from Thailand, and making fake story to my friends because they caught me doing gulu gulu 😅.
            </p>

        <p>My Forever Love,</p>
        
        <p>July 26th, 2025 - the day we said yes to forever, the day we promised each other 
        "Dal Chawal for Lifetime"! After taking blessings from Ganeshji, we made the most 
        beautiful commitment to each other.</p>
        
        <p>Dal Chawal - such simple words, but they represent everything about us. Simple, 
        pure, nourishing love that will sustain us through every day of our lives together. 
        Not fancy, not complicated, just real, honest, everyday love that fills the heart 
        and soul.</p>
        
        <p>When we said yes to each other that day, we weren't just saying yes to marriage - 
        we were saying yes to a lifetime of simple joys, shared meals, quiet moments, and 
        unconditional love. We were saying yes to being each other's home.</p>
        
        <p>With Ganeshji's blessings and our hearts full of love, we took the first step 
        towards our forever. Dal Chawal for lifetime - the most beautiful promise we could 
        make to each other.</p>

        <p>August 15th, 2025 - you flew all the way to Bangalore, and on the 16th, we shared 
        our first kiss. That moment when our lips met for the first time was pure magic - 
        tender, sweet, and filled with all the love we'd been building between us.</p>

        been sharing through words and looks and touches.</p>
        
        <p>That kiss sealed something between us, made our love feel more real, more

        for, worth all the distance and time that led us to that moment.</p>
        
        <p>Independence Day weekend became our own celebration of love and freedom - the 
        freedom to love each other completely, to express our feelings without holding back,
