                I still remember that day 📅 when my Mom called and asked me to see a couple of biodatas. It was a regular day, ekdum simple divas hato, and I was just casually scrolling through each of them... and then, suddenly, my eyes fell on <b>your</b> biodata. ✨
            </p>

            <p>
                Architect! 🏗️ Kaafi padhi-likhi aur sundar... <i>nai nai</i>, sundar nai, <b>haseen ladki!</b> 😍 Mane thayu ke "Vaah, aa to bahu j jordar chhe!" 
            </p>

            <p>
                But I pulled myself back and said to myself, "Chalo, let's not hype it up too much, pehla baat karke dekhte hai." 😊 Then I remember that first <b>"Heyy"</b> of <b>18th May 2025</b>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And oh god, you were taking forever to reply! 😂 <i>Ketli raah jovdaavi ti tame!</i> But who knew at that time that I was actually talking to the love of my life? ❤️
            </p>

            <p>
                But but... the real highlight is <b>20th May</b>. That day when you scolded me 😏... I don't want to say more about it here (just check the screenshots of that chat in the following memory section below! 📸). 
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                Looking back, I am so glad I swiped right on your life. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. 💍✨

        <p>June 24th, 2025 - my birthday became infinitely more special because of you and 
        your adorable "Tir-i-miss-u". The way you made this day about us, about our connection,

        <p>Your sweet words, your thoughtfulness, the way you made me feel so loved and 
        cherished on my special day - it was better than any gift I could have asked for. 
        You turned an ordinary birthday into an extraordinary celebration of our love.</p>
        
        <p>That "Tir-i-miss-u" wasn't just words - it was your heart speaking to mine, 
        telling me how much I meant to you. It was the most beautiful birthday gift anyone 
        has ever given me.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for making my birthday magical, for showing me what it feels like to 
        be truly loved and celebrated. Every birthday from now on will remind me of this 
        perfect moment with you.</p>

        <p>July 4th, 2025 - the day you showed incredible courage and love by going to 
        Vadodara to meet my family without me there! I still can't believe how brave you 
        were, how much you cared about us to take that step.</p>
        
        <p>Your dedication to our relationship, your willingness to face my family alone, 
        showed me just how serious you were about us. It wasn't just about meeting them - 
        it was about showing them who you are, what you mean to me, and how much you love me.</p>
        
        <p>That smile of yours, that confidence, that genuine warmth - you won them over 
        completely. They saw what I see in you every day: a beautiful soul, a loving heart, 
        and someone who truly cares about family and relationships.</p>
        
        <p>I knew then, more than ever, that you were truly the one. Someone who would go 
        to such lengths for love, who would face any challenge for us - that's the person 
        I want to spend my life with.</p>
